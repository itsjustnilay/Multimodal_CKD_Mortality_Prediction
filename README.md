# Enhancing Prognosis of Chronic Kidney Disease-Related Outcomes through Multimodal Deep Learning Approaches

*This project was developed in collaboration with Yawen Wei, Kiara Zhang and Shangyun Zhangliang for YSPH course BIS 550.*

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) presents a significant global health burden, leading to substantial
annual mortality rates. Timely detection and precise prognosis are pivotal for effective CKD
management. In this project, we employ a multifaceted deep learning approach to enhance the
accuracy of CKD prognosis. Our investigation encompasses a spectrum of models and
methodologies, ranging from logistic regression, XGBoost, to LSTM, BERT, and BART models.
Leveraging the MIMIC-III dataset, comprising de-identified health records from intensive care
units, we amalgamate relevant tables to construct a comprehensive dataset. We adhere to the
OMOP CDM standards for data standardization, encompassing structured values alongside
unstructured variables.
Noteworthy insights include the balanced performance observed with ElasticNet and BERT, as
well as the precision-oriented nature of XGBoost and BART models. While LSTM exhibits
promise, its efficacy across certain CKD classes may necessitate further optimization. Evaluation
of our models encompasses diverse metrics such as training loss, validation accuracy, and AUC
curves, providing a comprehensive assessment of performance.
